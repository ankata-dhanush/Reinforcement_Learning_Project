# Reinforcement Learning Project

The objective of this project is to train an environment such that agent collect the maximum rewards and reaches the final destination.
The Agent intention is to collect the maximum reward possible and reach the final destination.

I created this project into 2 parts.
Part1:
Training the environment using SARSA Algorithm. We will make the environment ready by checking the rewards available in the environment. The rewards is awarded with 1 and above points, environment with no rewards is provided with 0.25 points.
SARSA Algorithm is a Dynamic Programming algorithm where reqards are set to higher weights and no rewards is set to equal or no weights, such that agent can distinquish to collect the reward and reach the destination.

Part2:
Simulating the Agent to collect the maximum rewards possible and reach the destination. Once the environement is ready it collects the maximum reward available and reaches the final destination.

End Goal of the Project
What ever rewards you give for the environments, the agent will collect maximum rewards possible and reach the goal.
